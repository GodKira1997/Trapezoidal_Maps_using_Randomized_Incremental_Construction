# Assignment 03

This assignment includes 2 python files and 1 PDF document namely "structure.py", "trapezoidal_maps.py" and "Assign2_Anurag_Kallurwar_Neel_Chaudhary.pdf". 
The "trapezoidal_maps.py" reads the input file 
containing bounding box and segments and implements the Random Increemental Algortihm
to create a trapezoidal map.
This implementation prints the unique trapezoids and writes a adjacency matrix 
for the resultant directed
acyclic graph (DAG)

## Pre-requisites

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install 
libraries (if required).

```bash
pip install sys
pip install Enum
pip install math
pip install csv
```

## Usage
### For trapezoidal_map.py
```commandline
trapezoidal_map.py ak6491.txt
```

## Output
The output file is created in the same folder as the python files 
(execution folder).
### For trapezoidal_map.py
```markdown
"output_dag_matrix.csv" file is created containing the output adjacency matrix.
```
